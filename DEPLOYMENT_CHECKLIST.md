# üöÄ Deployment Checklist

## ‚ùå Current Status: NOT READY

### üî¥ Critical Issues Fixed
- ‚úÖ Database schema updated to PostgreSQL
- ‚úÖ User creation added to multiplayer API
- ‚úÖ Environment variables documented

### üî¥ Still Need to Fix

#### 1. Database Migration
```bash
# Run this before deployment
npm run db:push
```

#### 2. Environment Variables for Production
Update these in your deployment platform:
```env
# Production URLs (replace with actual domains)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL=https://your-app.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://your-app.com

# Database (already configured)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
DIRECT_URL=postgresql://...

# API Keys (already configured)
CMC_API_KEY=ab2105f9-5414-4f94-82a9-356e7ced0cb2
```

#### 3. Socket Server Architecture Issue
**PROBLEM**: Current setup uses separate server process (server.ts) which won't work on most deployment platforms.

**SOLUTIONS**:
- **Option A**: Deploy to platforms supporting WebSockets (Railway, Render)
- **Option B**: Integrate Socket.io into Next.js API routes
- **Option C**: Use external WebSocket service (Pusher, Ably)

#### 4. CORS Configuration
Update socket server CORS for production:
```typescript
cors: { origin: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL }
```

### üü° Recommended Before Deploy

1. **Test with PostgreSQL locally**
2. **Add error boundaries for Socket connection failures**
3. **Add loading states for all API calls**
4. **Test multiplayer with real users**

### üü¢ Ready When
- [ ] Database migrated to PostgreSQL
- [ ] Socket server deployed or integrated
- [ ] Environment variables updated
- [ ] CORS configured for production domain
- [ ] Tested end-to-end in production environment

## Quick Deploy Options

### Option 1: Vercel + Railway
- Deploy Next.js app to Vercel
- Deploy Socket server to Railway
- Update environment variables

### Option 2: Single Platform (Render/Railway)
- Deploy entire app including Socket server
- Simpler but requires platform supporting WebSockets

The app has solid functionality but needs deployment architecture fixes!
